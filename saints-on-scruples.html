  <h2 style="color: white;">What did some of the Saints and other holy people have to say about scruples?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <blockquote style="color: white;">
        "We may conclude that persons who suffer from scruples are the most favored by divine love, and the most certain of reaching Heaven when they bear this trial in patience and humility. Scrupulous souls die continually, they suffer a continual purgatory, and so they leave the earth to fly to Heaven purified and free from sins to expiate." – 
        <span style="color: yellow;">Blessed Henry of Suso</span>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <blockquote style="color: white;">
        "Scruples, too…  hinder devotion; for they are like thorns which prick the conscience and diquiet it, and will not allow it to find repose and comfort in God."– 
        <span style="color: yellow;">Saint Peter of Alcantara </span>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <blockquote style="color: white;">
        "Scruples, temptations, and fears, and cutting perplexities of the heart, are often the lot of the most excellent persons." – 
        <span style="color: yellow;">Thomas à Kempis</span>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <blockquote style="color: white;">
        “Let scrupulous persons suffer this cross of theirs with resignation and not perplex themselves. God Himself sends it to them for a number of good reasons: So that they may be more humble, so that they may be on their guard against the occasion of real sin, so that they may more often commend themselves to the Lord in prayer and put their entire trust in the Divine Goodness. Let them also often have recourse to the Blessed Virgin Mary” – 
        <span style="color: yellow;">St. Alphonsus Liguori</span>
      </blockquote> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <blockquote style="color: white;">
        "Anxiety is the soul's greatest enemy, sin only excepted. Therefore, above all else, calm and compose your mind, gently and quietly pursue your aim" – 
        <span style="color: yellow;">St. Francis de Sales</span>
