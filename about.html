    <h2 style="color: yellow; text-decoration: underline;">About This Site</h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
    Over the years I have gathered various useful materials about the spiritual life that I would like to share with the world. 
    </p>
    <p style="color: white;">
      This site exists to offer resources and insights; in addition to having a particular emphasis on aiding the scrupulous in their struggle for holiness. Alphonsus on Rye is inspired by Saint Alphonsus Liguori. This holy Saint is the patron of 2 things I find myself passionate in talking about; scrupulosity and moral theology. I hope what you find on this site is helpful for you in your relationship with the Most High God.
